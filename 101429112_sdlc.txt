Importance of learning DevOps in the
software development cycle.

Learning DevOps is important in software development because it connects the development and operations teams, improving teamwork and efficiency. DevOps helps streamline processes and allows for continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD), which means software can be released faster and with fewer errors. By using automation and monitoring, teams can maintain stability and scale their applications effectively. In today's fast-moving tech world, understanding DevOps is key to staying competitive and delivering better products to customers. Overall, it helps teams work smarter and respond more quickly to feedback.

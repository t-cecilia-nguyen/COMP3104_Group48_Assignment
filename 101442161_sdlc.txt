Importance of learning DevOps in the software development cycle:

The importance of learning DevOps in the software development cycle lies in 

the speed and efficiency it allows teams to work in. By using processes such 

as continuous integration and deployment, teams are able to deploy their products 

at a more efficient pace, by integrating automation. This approach allows closer collaboration 

between development and operations teams, improving communication as a whole and creating

the best possible environment to create a high quality software. DevOps' methodology allows 

a large degree of flexibility, allowing teams to adapt their product to any potential needs that 

may arise. DevOps' focus on constant review and communication between teams further improves the ability

to accurately monitor the product at every stage of the process, reducing complications and improving the 

time it would take to find a solution should an issue arise.
